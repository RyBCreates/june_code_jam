## Future Goals

### Adding Events to Schedule

- Currently this feature is not working, but when a user clicks on a Trip they will be directed to the Trip Editor, where they can customize their daily schedule for that specific trip.

### Collaboration

- In future iterations, users will be able to join together into groups and share their trips between devices and update them together!

### Mapping the Trip

- Users will be able to see on a map, where their trip is and be able to look up restaurants or museums or other events to add to their itineraries.
